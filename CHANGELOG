[200227]

Replaced compton with picom
Updated precompiled packages
Tidied up some code
Improved installer fatal error checking


[191028]

Fixed major issue with sudo inside subshells where authentication was needed twice
	-> echo -e "$password" | sudo -Sv specified in subshells to reauthenticate
		<- using !tty_tickets would solve the problem, but create a massive security hole, in that any process run by the user would have sudo access during that time
Fixed major bug where polybar messed up commands which relied on STDIN
	-> appended >/dev/null 2>&1 &
Fixed major issues with recovery functions
	-> removed all systemd-inhibit's from function calls
		-> these caused errors, presumably should be run as root ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
	-> fixed ownership permissions of /home/user on factory reset
	-> fixed permissions of /var/recovery where files were set to 444, thus recovery user could not overwrite files in monocleOS update
		-> set to 700, allows recovery rwx
	-> added extract & reinstall monocleOS to factory reset function
	-> added configuration needed for various configs when reinstalled, i.e. polybar.conf
Fixed zenity error dialogues where both error and success messages would show
	-> this got awfully confusing
	-> success dialogue is shown at end of subshell sequence. failed commands will exit with error, with || { zenity ...; exit 1 }, thus never reach success. :(
		<- error function should be implemented soon, else things gonna get messy
Made 'Waiting for automatic updates to stop' a separate function
Improved verfication of package for monocleOS --recoveryUpdate
	-> removed UUOC and added check for PKGBUILD
	-> added progress bar during extracting to keep the user entertained
Fixed extraction of package
	-> NTS: don't use relative paths in scripts...
Moved tips-service --daemon to .xinitrc from i3 config in order to make it die when x is killed
Reduced sleep time in polybar.sh
Increased width of recovery key entry dialogue
Improved UI of WiFi dialogues. Added progress bar for connecting
Added check for root in initMonocle
Fixed a bug in initMonocle where $USER was referenced - should be passed as $1
Fixed bug in funcRecoveryKey where $HOST was referenced - this is called $HOSTNAME in bash
monocleOS-recovery --format didn't include hidden dirs/files, fixed by specifying two wildcards: * & .*
Added duration of install to installer.sh
Added plymouth & xzoom to Precompiled_Packages
Added gnome-keyring and mkinitpcio (may be replaced by dracut in future) to packages
Removed lock hint, as it cannot show over gnome-screensaver due to tty locking


[191005]

Improved efficiency of tips-service
	-> tips are defined in arrays (app tips use associative arrays), removing a billion if statements
	-> makes adding new tips easier
Corrected wording in automatic-updates.timer, grubUpgrade.hook
Changed recovery key save message
Automatic updates fixed
	-> unit is run as root
	-> update is run by sudo -u monocle
		-> allows systemd-inhibit to work. cannot find a reason as to why this didn't before
Switched location of lock and power off icon
Added new hostname on reset
Recovery
	-> reinstall monocle now builds package in separate directory
	-> added manual update of monocleOS package option
		-> funcUpdateCopy requires recovery user password to copy to /var/recovery
		-> trivial check is performed to verify that package is monocleos by grep
	-> added hostname to recovery key document
	-> closes all open applications gracefully when starting action
Polybar
	-> added labels to window buttons
	-> added closeAll function, using i3 [class=".*"] kill
Various bug fixes
Added linux & linux-firmware to packages.txt
	-> for some stupid reason it was removed from base group


[190912]

Removed unused files from tar:
	-> camera_shutter.wav, cronUpdate, systab
Replaced grub-shusher with grub-silent
	-> removed 10_linux
	-> changed /etc/default/grub
	-> doesn't seem to build grub-mkfont, thus unicode.pf2 has been added to pkg. installer.sh will copy if needed to /boot/grub/fonts
Included efibootmgr for efi without secure boot
	-> changed label for secure boot to 'monocleOS Signed'
Polybar does not start on .firstBoot
Added support for installing precompiled packages on install
	-> will install all packages in dir, shortening install time
	-> obvs they'll still be compiled on auto updates
installer.sh:
	-> tabs changed to spaces to prevent arch-chroot (bash) interpreting them for tab-completion
	-> for loop inside own echo '' as local var didn't expand
	-> created INSTALL.sh, redirects all output to a log file and takes installDisk as an argument
Factory reset:
	-> using a hardcoded location for a tmp keyfile instead of echoing it to luksKeyChange
		-> added appropriate sudoers
	-> shreds all files in /home/user if overwrite=1 - does not unmount /home and reformat (this was a stupid idea)
Increase iconPadding to allow for larger fonts
Added x-systemd.device-timeout=0 to fstab for root


[190908]

Added systemd-inhibit to recovery reinstall functions
Added pgrep update to recovery reinstall functions
	-> sends SIGINT and waits for it to stop every 11s w/ zenity dialogue
Pointed all pacman hook execs to /usr/bin/update
Grub-shusher implemented to patch grub on update by pacman hook
	-> added to installer.sh
Grub is reinstalled on update of package
Fixed efiPath logic in installer
Changed some wording for zenity dialogues
Environment vars from install are echoed to /etc/monocleOS.env and sourced instead of sed'ing files
Moved all reinstall and factory reset recovery options to a separate executable -> this can be referenced outside of /usr/bin/monocleOS in the future e.g. an RE
Added a factory reset option in settings
	-> extra sudoers lines needed: user can execute factory reset as root with user password
	-> arch-install-scripts required for genfstab - could replace with sed but that's a pain
		-> this also allows monocleOS to be installed from itself with installer.sh, could be implemented in future but needs to be made graphical
Removed redundant else statements in monocleOS where || was also specified
	-> this only caused issues
cp changelog to new root


[190902]

Replaced cron with systemd timers
Increased width of shutdown, sleep, etc. timer dialogues
Used i3 reload in place of pkill x where possible
Added tips-service
	-> daemon is started in i3 config
	-> settings added in monocleOS, separate config file
Fixed Files desktop icon, exec'ing nautilus -> thunar
Plymouth
	-> added plymouth 'Enter your password' dialogue
		-> image overlays entry box, becomes transparent when bullets appear, returns when none.
	-> lowered goodbye on shutdown
Fixed initMonocle not removing line from sudoers.d/monocleOS
Rejigged some code for launchers to check if entries file exists
Added default vars in case user config file does not exist
All user applications are launched from application-wrapper
	-> allows various 'hooks' to be implemented easily
	-> used for showing a hint per app, on launch


[190822]

Changed lockscreen from i3lock-color to gnome-screensaver
	-> locks at tty level and looks more like plymouth
	-> configured on firstBoot
Changed from py3status to polybar
	-> removed redundant packages for py3status
	-> removed desktop launcher search button
		<- lowered desktop launcher search button
		<- made launcherSearch windowed to fit under polybar
	-> added awesome and material icons fonts
	-> added buttons to allow floating, and window layouts
		-> made i3 click to focus for this reason
	-> installer replaced BATTERY & BACKLIGHT_PLACEHOLDER in polybar.conf on install, if available
Removed launcherSearch from desktop and added launcherMenu to polybar
	-> added to SettingsThemeColour by launcher.conf
Added dunst as notification daemon
	-> started in xinitrc
	-> added dunstrc to SettingsThemeColour
Changed screenshot logic - no button, only PrtScr does -i
Removed window decoration for gtk-3.0, replaced uniformly by polybar
Internet connectivity check moved to monocleOS, for use externally, from initMonocle
	-> also not exec'd by root which is more secure
Added warning dialogue for advanced settings
Reduced magnification to 2x
	-> changed notification to notify-send instead of zenity
Made gnome-calculator float by default
Improved wording of dialogues
Added pavucontrol as sound option
Re-added goodbye to plymouth with nicer coding, needs testing
